### About 

This is a site where you can find some open source audio hardware designs,
including interfaces, DACs and amplifiers. 
All the projects are developed in accordance with our interests.

Apart from that,
some notes on hardware design may be published.

### Again

The site was hosted in another server until it crashed one day.
We lost the data and decided to build a new one on GitHub.
